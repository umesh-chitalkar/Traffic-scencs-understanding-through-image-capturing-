# Traffic Scenes Understanding Through Image Capturing

## 📸 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing traffic scenes by capturing and processing images to understand the environment and detect objects. It leverages computer vision techniques to extract meaningful data from road scenarios, potentially aiding in smart transportation systems, autonomous driving, and traffic monitoring.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🚗 Detection of various traffic elements like vehicles, signals, pedestrians.
- 📷 Image capturing through cameras or preloaded datasets.
- 💻 Use of computer vision techniques (e.g., edge detection, segmentation).
- 📊 Data processing and visualization of detected objects.
- 📁 Organized structure for models, data, and outputs.
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- (Add any deep learning framework like TensorFlow/PyTorch if used)
